Reload Club Webapp.

## Dependencies

- Node/NPM.

## Instructions

Run `npm install` then `npm start`. Access the app on `localhost:3000`.

## Linting

- All `js` and `html` files are linted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- All `css` and `scss` files are linted using [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).

Before any commit, run `npm run lint` to check any misslinted code and `npm run format` to autofix the errors. Some erros can't be automatically fixed, so you'll have to fix them manually before push your work.
